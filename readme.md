## Coding: TypeScript Basic


Create a new TypeScript project in IntelliJ and perform the following simple coding tasks:

* Step 1: Create an array of numbers. Use the '.map' function to double all the numbers in the array.
* Step 2: Create an array of words. Use the '.filter' function to select only the words that are longer than 5 letters.
* Step 3: Create an array of numbers. Use the '.reduce' function to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the array.
* Step 4: Create an array of numbers. Use the '.some' function to check if at least one number is greater than 10.
* If you have already completed this task earlier, you may work on the bonus task on the next page.

## Bonus

Use only array functions for the following tasks.
Take this list of numbers:

```javascript
const list = [15, 6, 3213, 9, 0, 12, 8464 , 1, 1264, 481, 186, 1031, 194];
```

* Sort these numbers in descending order.
* Square these numbers.
* Remove the lowest two numbers and the highest 4 numbers from the list.
* Remove all numbers that are divisible by 4.
* Add up all the numbers.

What is the result?
